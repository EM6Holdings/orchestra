Our Motivation
==============

Unlimited Labs has open sourced Orchestra as part of our mission to empower creative and analytical experts in practicing their craft.

We are a small team in NYC. Weâ€™re passionate about improving the future of how people do creative and analytical work. We have a strong team of designers and engineers from UC Berkeley, Harvard, MIT, and RPI who have worked extensively on systems that help people work productively online.

Beyond focusing on profit, we believe that the products and experiences we design should be considerate of their greater social context and impact. To stay true to these values, we are in the process of becoming a B-certified corporation.
